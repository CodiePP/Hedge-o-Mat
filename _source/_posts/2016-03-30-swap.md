Exchange of cash flows from fixed interest for floating interest.
Several types: interest rate swap, currency swap, equity swap, volatility swap,
commodity swap, ...

Example of a plain vanilla interest rate swap using bonds:
discount fixed rate cash flows, discount floating rate cash flows and take
difference.
fixed rate=6%,semiannually, floating rates=(5.4%,5.6%,5.8%), 1M notional, every
6 months, for 1.5 years.
$$ B_{fixed} = 30'000 e^{-(0.054*0.5)} + 30'000 e^{-(0.056*1)} + 1'030'000
e^{-(0.058*1.5)} = 1'001'744.42 $$
$$ B_{floating} = 1'000'000 * (1 + \frac{0.05}{2}) e^{(-0.054*0.5)} = 997'695.27
$$
$$ V_{swap} = (B_{fixed} - B_{floating}) = 4'049.15 $$

Example of currency swap valuation using forwards:
paid rate for USD: 5%, received rate for GBP: 6%
GBPUSD = 1.50, interest rates in USD: 2%, GBP: 4%, time: 2 years, annually paid.

Forward rate calculation: $$ F_1 = 1.5 e^{(2{\%}-4{\%})*T)} $$
