fourth momentum of returns:

$$ t = x - mean(x) $$

$$ m = mean(t ^ 4) $$

$$ s = mean(t ^ 2) $$

$$ kurtosis = \frac{m}{s^2} $$

A normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3.

If kurtosis < 3 then the distribution is `platykurtic` (looks flatter than normal distr., more mass in the centre, has smaller tails),

if kurtosis > 3 then the disitribution is said to be `leptokurtic` (more peaked than normal distr. and larger tails!).
