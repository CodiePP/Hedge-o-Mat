Measures the variance of a series of values around their mean value.

$$ Var(X)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_i{(X_i-\bar{X})^2} $$

where $$ \bar{X}=\frac{1}{N}*\sum_i{X_i} $$

The variance can be computed incrementally:

$$ Var(X)=\bar{X^2}-(\bar{X}*\bar{X}) $$

Thus, we sum all $$X_i$$ and all $$X_i^2$$, then build the difference of their
mean values.
