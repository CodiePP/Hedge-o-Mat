A futures contract is traded on an exchange and defines an underlying asset to
be exchanged for a specified price at a future date (usually a designated
month).
<ul>
<li>defines underlying asset, price, date of exchange</li>
<li>traded on an exchange</li>
<li>short and long positions</li>
<li>minimized counter party risk via broker and daily fixing</li>
</ul>
In contrast to a [forward](forward.html), a
futures contract is traded on an exchange. This reduces the risk of a counter
party default and provides increased liquidity.
