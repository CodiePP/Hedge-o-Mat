third momentum of returns:

$$ t = x - mean(x) $$

$$ m = mean(t ^ 3) $$

$$ s = mean(t ^ 2) $$

$$ skewness = \frac{m}{s^{\frac{3}{2}}} $$

positive skewness indicates a `right tail` and the mass of the data on the left ($$< \mu$$);

negative skewness indicates a `left tail` and the mass of the data on the right ($$> \mu$$).
