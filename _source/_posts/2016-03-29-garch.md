A GARCH process is similar to an EWMA (exponentially weighted moving average)
used for predicting volatility (rather variance).
In most cases the process used is GARCH(1,1). GARCH(p,q) means that we calculate
the variance from p observations of u<sup>2</sup> and the most recent
predictions of the variance σ<sup>2</sup>.

$$ \sigma^2_t = \gamma V_L + \alpha u^2_{t-1} + \beta \sigma^2_{t-1} $$

where $$ \gamma + \alpha + \beta = 1 $$

V<sub>L</sub> is the long-run average variance

the coefficients α, β and γ assign weights to the predictors.

Often the formula is written as

$$ \sigma^2_t = \omega + \alpha u^2_{t-1} + \beta \sigma^2_{t-1} $$

since $$ \gamma = 1 - \alpha - \beta $$ we must ensure that $$ \alpha + \beta < 1 $$, otherwise ω is negative.

β can be interpreted as the decay rate of the contribution of previous values of the variance.
The model is mean reverting.

<h2>GARCH(p,q)</h2>
(from the book [Introductory Econometrics for Finance](../books/brooks-introductory-econometrics-for-finance.html) by Chris Brooks)

$$ \sigma^2_t = \alpha_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{q} \alpha_iu^2_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_j \sigma^2_{t-j} $$


<h2>Estimation of GARCH models using <em>maximum likelihood</em></h2>
Given the parameters (&alpha;, &beta;, &omega;) of the GARCH model
we estimate how well it produced the observed data.
