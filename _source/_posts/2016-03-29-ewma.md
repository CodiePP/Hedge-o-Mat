This models and predicts the volatility from previous values plus a
fraction of the latest return.

$$ \sigma^2_t = \lambda \sigma^2_{t-1} + (1 - \lambda) u^2_{t-1} $$

where $$ u_t = ln(\frac{S_t}{S_{t-1}}) $$ is the log return between spot prices.

For the `RiskMetrics` system &lambda; was set to 0.94.
