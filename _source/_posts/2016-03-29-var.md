Value at risk measures the maximal loss at a certain significance level over a
certain time span. Often this figure is indicated in absolute values of total
assets, but a percentage value is also seen.

The significance level (or 1 - confidence level) depends on our attitude towards
risk. The more risk we can bear, the higher this value. The Basel II accord
demands banks to calculate VAR at the 1% significance level (i.e. 99% confidence
level).

The time span or risk horizon should match our exposure to the assets in trading
days. The Basel II accord demands banks to calculate VAR for a 10 days horizon.
The more liquid an investment the shorter the risk horizon and vice versa. For
extremely liquid positions like major currency pairs, VAR is calculated
intra-day.
