$$mean=\mu$$

$$variance=(\frac{c}{c-2})\sigma^2$$

parameter c is degrees of freedom. The variance approaches the one of the normal distribution for large c.

$$t=\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{S_X/\sqrt{n}}$$

where $$ {S_X}^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum{(X_i-\bar{X})^2} $$ is the standard deviation of the sample. 

Given some precalculated values from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution) statistics tables, we can find the associated probability.
