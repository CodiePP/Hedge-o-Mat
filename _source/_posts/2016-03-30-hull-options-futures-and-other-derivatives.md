Hull, J.
<em>Options, Futures, and other Derivatives</em>
Prentice Hall, 7th ed., <strong>2008</strong>

This is a "must" read! The book covers thoroughly all major aspects of valuing
derivatives. It can also serve as a handbook for the practice oriented who needs
quick answers and illustrative examples.

[I will put here its table of content, once found]
