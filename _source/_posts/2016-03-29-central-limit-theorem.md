The central limit theorem states that if $$X_1,\. X_2,\. X_3,\. \cdots,\. X_n$$
is a random sample from any population with mean $$\mu_X$$ and variance
$$\sigma_X^2$$, then the sample mean approaches $$\bar{X} \sim
N(\mu_X,\.\frac{\sigma_X^2}{n})$$, thus is normal distributed around the mean of
all X, but with lower variance as the sample size increases.
