While studying financial risk management I felt the need to collect the
knowledge floating on the Internet and submerged in books.

Moreover, I also collect some spreadsheets or `octave` / `R` code, which 
may freely be reused under the open source [MIT license](license).

The name should suggest that we can still hope to find methods and computer
algorithms that will automatically mitigate risks.

I am interested to hear your comments and advices. Contact me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CodiePlusPlus) or
open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/CodiePP/Hedge-o-Mat/issues), please.
