The forward rate agreement (FRA) is a contract that specifies the underlying to
be exchanged for a specified price at a future date. One party takes the long
position (will buy the underlying), the other the short position (will sell the
underlying).

FRAs are traded in the OTC (over-the-counter) market. Therefore, they exhibit an
increased counter party risk on default. This is the main difference to a 
[futures contract](future.html).

The payoff of a long forward contract is: $$ S_T - K $$ where S<sub>T</sub> is
the spot price of the underlying at time T and K is the delivery price. For the
short position the sign changes.

Value of a long forward contract: $$ f = S_0 e^{-qT} - K e^{-rT} $$ where S0, q,
T, K, and r are asset price, dividend yield, time to maturity, delivery price,
and risk-free rate.
